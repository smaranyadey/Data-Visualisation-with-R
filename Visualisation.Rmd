title: "Creating Stories From Data"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Once we are completed our data analysis and modeling activities, we need to present the same to the wider audiences. For working professionals, the audience can vary from internal team members to the leadership team. To engage with them, we need to build stories using the model findings and insights. And, one of the important elements of those stories is going to be visualisation.

In R, there are a number of packages which we can utilise to create compelling plots. We will primarily be focusing on **ggplot2** and **plotly** here.


## Introduction to ggplot2

ggplot2 is part of **tidyverse** family of packages created for Data Science. It helps us to create graphics based on the data provided to it. 

### How does ggplot2 works?

Let us install the library first.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

Let's take R built-in dataset *mpg* to understand how to create different charts/plots using the package.

```{r}
data("mpg")
str(mpg)
```

We have information about manufactures, models, classes and types of cars in this dataset.

```{r}
head(mpg, 5)
```

Let's say we want to have a scatter plot between the engine displacement (*displ* column) and highway miles (*hwy* column). To draw this scatter plot, let us see how **ggplot** works in a step-by-step manner.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = mpg,
            aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
p
```

Well, the above code has created an empty graph with x and y axis as *displ* and *hwy* respectively. 

#### What did we do here?
We created a ggplot object, specifying the data frame to use to be *mpg* and aesthetic mapping *aes*. The mapping is to mention how the variables in the data are mapped to visual properties.

#### What do we need to bring the scatter plot?
We need to add what do we want to be on the graph to the existing ggplot object. We will have to add *geom_point* function for creating scatter plot. *geom_*functions are the geometrical properties for bar, line, scatter plots in the ggplot system.

```{r}
p <- p + geom_point()
p
```

## Introduction to plotly

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
dim(cars)
```




## Data Usage

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
